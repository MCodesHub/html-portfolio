  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a solution-oriented professional with a strong background in operations,
    engineering, and software development. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of
    Science in Computer Science at Arizona State University, maintaining a 3.99 GPA.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since August 2025, I have been working at RxSafe as a
    <strong>Technical Support Specialist for Pharmacy Automation</strong>.
    In this role, I support complex automation systems by troubleshooting
    software, hardware, and configuration issues, collaborating closely with
    engineers, and analyzing logs and system behavior to resolve production issues.
  </p>

  <p>
    My technical skill set includes SQL, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    I also have working knowledge of modern frameworks and technologies such as
    <strong>React, Node.js, and Spring Boot</strong>, and I continue expanding my
    full-stack development skills through academic projects and hands-on experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to my technical career, I served in the United States Army in multiple
    leadership roles, where I developed strong problem-solving abilities,
    operational discipline, and team leadership skills. This experience shaped
    my ability to work effectively in fast-paced, high-responsibility environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am highly detail-oriented, adaptable, and motivated to grow as a software
    engineer by building reliable systems, improving processes, and continuously
    learning new technologies.
